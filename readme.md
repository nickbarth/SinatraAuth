# SinatraAuth

This is an example implementation of authentication in Sinatra.
It comes complete with integration, and unit tests using RSpec and Capybara, 
and uses ActiveRecord as an ORM.

My intention is that this code can be used, or built upon in your own Sinatra
applications. Feel free to contribute suggestions, fixes, and comments via pull
requests, or the issue tracker. :octocat:
